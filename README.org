#+TITLE: Wiki2 using scribble

* TODO list

** TODO switch
The emacs scribble mode is not powerful enough. Thus I cannot switch yet.

Currently, the compiling process: first in this repo, run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
raco pkg install
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will make the current project under raco control. Then in any
directory, run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
raco setup wiki2
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will use =scribblings= variable in this =info.rkt= to render
htmls, into =doc/= folder.

** use info.rkt as Makefile

So that raco scribble will compile all .scrbl files into appropriate
directory with proper hierarchy.

** Better Emacs support

My own scribble-mode.

** cross linking and multi-page hierarchy
** codeblock for different langs
** Style file
** pdf output
